## Introduction

Water is one of our most precious resources, and its sustainable management is crucial for the well-being of our planet and future generations. The concept of a "water footprint" helps us quantify the amount of water used directly and indirectly to produce goods and services. This project aims to shed light on water consumption patterns and their environmental implications.

## Project Goals

The main objectives of this project are:

- To calculate and analyze the water footprint of common products, activities, and lifestyles.
- To raise awareness about the water usage associated with everyday choices.
- To provide data-driven insights that can inform individuals and policymakers about water conservation strategies.

## Data

Our analysis relies on a diverse set of data sources, including:

- **Water Usage Data**: We collect data on water consumption associated with various activities, industries, and products. This includes both direct and indirect water usage.

- **Geospatial Data**: Geographical information is essential for understanding regional variations in water availability and usage. We use GIS data to map water stress and availability.

- **Product Lifecycle Data**: To calculate the water footprint of products, we gather information on their entire lifecycle, from production to disposal.

All data sources are documented in the `data` directory of this repository.

## Analysis

Our analysis includes the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: We clean and preprocess the raw data to ensure consistency and accuracy.

2. **Water Footprint Calculation**: Using established methodologies, we calculate the water footprint of various activities, products, and lifestyles.

3. **Visualization**: We create informative visualizations to present our findings, including charts, maps, and infographics.

4. **Interpretation**: We provide insights and interpretations of the results, highlighting key takeaways and areas of concern.

## Results

Our findings and results are documented in the `results` directory of this repository. Please refer to this section for detailed reports, charts, and other materials summarizing our research.
