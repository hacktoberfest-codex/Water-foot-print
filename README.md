## Overviewüìù

Welcome to the Water Footprint Project! This GitHub repository contains all the code, data, and documentation for our research and analysis on water footprints calculator. In this project, we aim to explore and understand the water consumption patterns associated with various activities, products, and lifestyles.

## What is water footprint & how does it affect us?

The water footprint measures the amount of water used to produce each of the goods and services we use. The water footprint helps us understand for what purposes our limited freshwater resources are being consumed and polluted. The impact of it depends on where the water is taken from and when if it comes from a place where water is already scarce, the consequences can be significant and require action. The increase in the amount of non- available water due to pollution and scarce groundwater level has added more water footprints, at the community as well as at the personal levels. An increased water footprint directly affects the health and future of the citizens. 

#How to reduce the waterfootprints?‚úÖ
Preventing severe drought in water-stressed areas is only going to be possible if water is used with more care and efficiency, this can be done if we have readily available data on water footprints. By using digital technologies and computer languages,  website may be developed which can provide the water footprints of different items/ final products we use in daily life by feeding little inputs

## Introductionüï∏Ô∏è

Water is one of our most precious resources, and its sustainable management is crucial for the well-being of our planet and future generations. The concept of a "water footprint" helps us quantify the amount of water used directly and indirectly to produce goods and services. This project aims to shed light on water consumption patterns and their environmental implications.

## Project Goals‚úÖ

The main objectives of this project are:

- To calculate and analyze the water footprint of common products, activities, and lifestyles.
- To raise awareness about the water usage associated with everyday choices.
- To provide data-driven insights that can inform individuals and policymakers about water conservation strategies.
- To alert users of the heavy water usages in their day to day life

## Dataüíª

Our analysis relies on a diverse set of data sources, including:

- **Water Usage Data**: We collect data on water consumption associated with various activities, industries, and products. This includes both direct and indirect water usage.

- **Geospatial Data**: Geographical information is essential for understanding regional variations in water availability and usage. We use GIS data to map water stress and availability.

- **Product Lifecycle Data**: To calculate the water footprint of products, we gather information on their entire lifecycle, from production to disposal.

All data sources are documented in the `data` directory of this repository.

## Analysisüìù

Our analysis includes the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: We clean and preprocess the raw data to ensure consistency and accuracy.

2. **Water Footprint Calculation**: Using established methodologies, we calculate the water footprint of various activities, products, and lifestyles.

3. **Visualization**: We create informative visualizations to present our findings, including charts, maps, and infographics.

4. **Interpretation**: We provide insights and interpretations of the results, highlighting key takeaways and areas of concern.

## Results‚úÖ

Our findings and results are documented in the `results` directory of this repository. Please refer to this section for detailed reports, charts, and other materials summarizing our research.
